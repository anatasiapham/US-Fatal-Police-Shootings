# US_Fatal_Police_Shootings

Hi, welcome to this project's reposititory. I hope that means you're interested in what I have learned as well! 

Purpose
Using public data collected by the Washington Post, I wanted to visualize and learn about the victims of fatal police shootings in the United States.

Brief Background
The Washington Post has been collecting data about fatal police encounters since 2015. T
he data used in this app was last updated on October 7th, 2022. These numbers reflect only the deaths that were reported by news or police departments. 
Oftentimes, these incidents are under reported and are therefore not accounted for in this data set.
