# US_Fatal_Police_Shootings

Hi, welcome to this project's reposititory. I hope that means you're interested in what I have learned as well! 

## Purpose
Using public data collected by the Washington Post, I wanted to visualize and learn about the victims of fatal police shootings in the United States.

## Brief Background
The Washington Post has been collecting data about fatal police encounters since 2015. The data used in this app was last updated on October 7th, 2022. These numbers reflect only the deaths that were reported by news or police departments. Oftentimes, these incidents are under reported and are therefore not accounted for in this data set.

## Create Streamlit App
Using Streamlit, I had the opportunity to share the dataset and information and for it to be readily accessible to any user. The source code and any other files used for the app can be found in the fps folder. To access the app, click [here](https://anatasiapham-us-fatal-police-shootings.streamlit.app/).

## Create Tableau Dashboard
Tableau was also utilized to visualize the information in this dataset. The Tableau Public Dashboard can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/W69KR25B6?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
